## Yue Liu ID:041128814 quiz site
## for quizlet, I go with pretty simples UI with a purple header displaying the title 'Quizlet.' The quiz begins with the user selecting a difficulty level, which then leads to a new page with a question based on their selection. After choosing an answer, the user submits the answer by clicking the button. The results page then appears, displaying whether its correct or not and also the total number of correct answers.
